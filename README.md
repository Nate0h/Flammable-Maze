# Flammable-Maze
AI Agents that tries to navigate a path through a randomly generated 51x51 maze, with the addition of a fire that spreads at random from the center of the maze.
All Agents utilize A* Search Algorithm for Planning of the paths 
Agent 1 - Plans the Shortest Path to the Goal cell ignoring the spreading fire
Agent 2 - Plans at every step that the fire spreads
Agent 3 - Plans path based on projected fire spread and moves to avoid that fire
Agent 4 - The flammability is maximized so the fire spreads quicker, but this agent can see further into the future than Agent 3
